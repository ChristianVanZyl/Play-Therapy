Play Therapy by Lenka De Villiers-Van Zyl is an e-commerce website commissioned for development by Lenka De Villiers-Van Zyl. 

Play Therapy by Lenka De Villiers-Van Zyl has been coded in several languages. HTML5 was used to a large extent, 
in conjunction with Bootstrap 4.4.1 and CSS, for the front-end of the website. 

JavaScript and JQuery 3.6.0 were used to a lesser extent and mainly used for validation and redirecting purposes. MySQL was chosen as the database
for the website. PHP 7.4.16 is used to form a connection to the database. It is further used to upload to, and download from, the database itself. 
The website was coded in Atom - an open-source text and source code editor.
